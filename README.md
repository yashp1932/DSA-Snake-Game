# Multiplayer Snake Game (C++) 🐍

A classic Snake game implemented in C++ supporting two players simultaneously. The project emphasizes the use of fundamental data structures and algorithms to manage game logic efficiently.

## Features ✨
- Two-player mode with independent snake controls
- Real-time snake movement and collision detection
- Dynamic food spawning and snake growth
- Console-based interface for simplicity and performance

## Data Structures & Algorithms 📚
- **Linked Lists:** Each snake is represented as a linked list to efficiently add or remove segments during movement and growth
- **Queues:** Manage the order of snake segments for smooth movement updates
- **Collision Detection:** Algorithms to check snake collisions with walls, self, and other snake using coordinate comparisons
- **Randomization:** Food spawning uses pseudo-random number generation to appear at valid positions on the grid
- **Game Loop:** Implements an efficient game loop with input polling, state updates, and rendering

## Controls 🎮
- **Player 1:** W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right)
- **Player 2:** Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →)
